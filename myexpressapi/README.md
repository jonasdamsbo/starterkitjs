## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

	npm start

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/. You can modify the PORT variable in the code or environment to change the default port.

## Adding Routes

To add a new route to your application, create a new file in the routes/ directory and define your route logic. Then include it in your app.js:

	const newRoute = require('./routes/newRoute');
	app.use('/newRoute', newRoute);

For example, create routes/example.js with:

	const express = require('express');
	const router = express.Router();

	router.get('/', function (req, res, next) {
	  res.send('Example route');
	});

	module.exports = router;

And add it to app.js:

	const exampleRoute = require('./routes/example');
	app.use('/example', exampleRoute);

## Static Files

Static files like CSS, JavaScript, or images can be served from the public/ directory. Place your files in public/, and they will be accessible automatically.

For example, a file at public/styles/style.css will be accessible at http://localhost:3000/styles/style.css.

## Middleware

Express allows you to use middleware for custom processing. Add middleware in app.js like this:

	app.use((req, res, next) => {
	  console.log('Request URL:', req.url);
	  next();
	});

## Building

No explicit build step is required for an Express.js application. However, you should ensure your project dependencies are installed:

	npm install

## Running Tests

If you have written unit or integration tests, you can run them using a test framework like Mocha or Jest. Install a test framework and run:

	npm test

## Deploying

To deploy your application, ensure all dependencies are installed and start the app:

	npm start

You can use tools like PM2 or Docker to run your application in production.
